# Active-Learning

Active Learning Implementation in Python

# Dataset

Dataset used is Natural Scenes Detection(Multi Label Image Classification) [click here](http://lamda.nju.edu.cn/files/miml-image-data.rar) to download dataset. Download the dataset and extract its content. Put "miml data.mat" file and "original" folder in "miml-image-data" folder

# Feature Extraction

Each image is represented by a feature vector using the method described in [Learning multi-label scene classification](https://www.rose-hulman.edu/~boutell/publications/boutell04PRmultilabel.pdf)

# Description

* extract_feature.py: python script to extract features from images
* dataset_294.h5: feature extracted dataset
